# SOGNO - microservices oriented power system automation

SOGNO aims at facilitating the transition to a modular microservices based control center software solution for distribution system operators. 
This allows operators to adapt faster because components can be updated more independently from each other. 
It provides system operators and automation software developers with an open source framework that exposes open APIs to plug in new automation functions and supports industry standards such as CIM IEC61970 and IEC61850.

The complete [documentation](https://sogno-platform.github.io) is available on github pages.
