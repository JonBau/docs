## Data Flow

The diagram below depicts the data flow between the services included in SOGNO.
The services should be as independent as possible from each other so that a deployment may include only few or all services depending on the user requirements.
The diagram can be also viewed in a [separate page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sogno-platform/sogno-platform.github.io/master/static/service-dataflow.svg).
